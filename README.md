# Task-6
PWM (turning on/off LEDs with Pulse-Width Modulation)

IMPORTANT Some variable declarations and function names are in my native language (Slovene). Reason being is, I did these assignments in the scope of my University. Hopefully the code will make sense as, I briefly explain the purpose of each task below.

In this exercise a program was implemented that turns 4 LED diodes on/off with an use of a PWM.

Timer must be set to a period of 5 seconds and LED's must be switched on in the following order:

	LED 1: turns on 1 second after the start of the period and stays turned on until the end of the period
   	LED 2: turns on 2 seconds after the start of the period and stays turned on until the end of the period
   	LED 3: turns on 3 seconds after the start of the period and stays turned on until the end of the period
   	LED 4: turns on 4 seconds after the start of the period and stays turned on until the end of the period

Tools used: STM32F429I discovery board (Cortex M4), breadboard, wires, resistor, Kingbright 10-segment LED bar graph array
